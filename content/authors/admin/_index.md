Dr. Lin Su is a Lecturer in Engineering Biology at the School of Biological and Behavioural Sciences, Queen Mary University of London. Prior to this role, he served as a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the University of Cambridge, where he was a member of the Reisner Lab in the Department of Chemistry (2021–2025). During this time, he spearheaded research on bio-hybrid systems for sustainable solar energy conversion. Dr. Su earned his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Southeast University in 2021, where he pioneered innovative approaches to optimize electron transfer between microorganisms and synthetic materials. As part of his doctoral training, he undertook a joint-PhD research program with Prof. Caroline Ajo-Franklin’s group (2016–2020), conducting synthetic biology research split between Berkeley, CA and Houston, TX.

Dr. Su’s research bridges biology and materials science to address pressing environmental and energy challenges. His group specializes in engineering microbial-material interfaces, with two key focuses: developing biohybrid platforms for semi-artificial photosynthesis to harness solar energy, and creating bioelectronic sensors that enable seamless communication between biological and electronic systems. This work has gained recognition for its potential to advance sustainable technologies, offering novel solutions for clean energy production and next-generation biocompatible devices.
